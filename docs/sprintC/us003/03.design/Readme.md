### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Person
* Employee

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RegisterEmployeeUI
* RegisterEmployeeController
* AgencyRepository
* RoleRepository
* PersonRepository
